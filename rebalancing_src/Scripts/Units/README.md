Only files that have been changed are included. Other scripts are the same as in original Earth2160_SDK. You can take them from SDK if you'd like to update them.

Description of changes:

Though Attack.ech affects allmost all *.eco files for units and may affect their behaviour, we don't want this. So only please put in the game only the following files which you get after compilation:
1. units.eco - all ground units (except for infantry) get attack point capability
2. plane.eco - patrol mode

These files should be included in the WD-file. No other changes in *.eco files is required.
